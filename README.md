# STA-145-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-145 final project. I took the discography of the top 200 songs of the 2010s. I analyzed the length of the songs and amount of streams the song received. 
## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "ippolia4.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "Final project data" file. 
## **Data**
The data collected for this project was from a list of top 200 songs from the 2010s according to Pitchfork. I analyzed the list by taking note of different characteristics of the songs, including song legnth and popularity through streams on spotify. Each unit of analysis is one song and there are 24 observations. 
## **Operationalization**
The concept of streams was operationalized through a quantitative variable counting the total number of streams a song has received on Spotify only, ranging from 30,381 to 2,592,850,634. 

The concept of song length was operationalized through a quantitative variable of seeing the song length from Spotify in minutes.
